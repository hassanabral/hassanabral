## 👋 Hi, I'm Hassan. 

I'm a 👨‍💻 full-stack web developer based in 📍 Blacksburg, VA. I have over 2 years of experience building single page web applications using **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Redux**. In my free time, I like to go on hiking, play figure-style acoustic guitar, and play DOTA 2.  

I am currently in my last year studying Computer Science at <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>. For more information about me, check out [hassanyakef.com](https://hassanyakef.com).
