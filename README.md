## 👋 Hi, I'm Hassan. 

I'm a full-stack web developer 👨‍💻  based in Blacksburg, VA. I have over 2 years of experience building single page web applications using **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Redux**.

I am currently in my last year studying Computer Science at <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>. For more information about me, check out <a href="https://hassanyakef.com">hassanyakef.com</a>.

### What I've been up to ...

I wrote a blog post about a **social networking app** that I recently build with `Cloud Firestore`. Check it out! https://hassanyakef.com/personal-project
