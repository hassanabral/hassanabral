## 👋 Hi, I'm Hassan. 

I'm a full-stack web developer based in Blacksburg, VA. I have over 2 years of experience building single page web applications using **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Redux**. In my free time, I like to go on hiking, play figure-style acoustic guitar, and play DOTA 2.  

I am currently in my last year studying Computer Science at <a href="https://vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a>. I will use this site to write blogs on my career journey as well as new technologies that I learn.
